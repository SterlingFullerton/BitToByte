# BitToByte

In todays day and age, learning a specific languages syntax is becoming less and less relevant with the prevelancy of services such as Github Copilot being able to aid you with the majority of your programming tasks in a given language. Allowing the user to focus more on the logical side of their program without having to worry or get bogged down with the syntactical side.

Our focus is on an interactive and gamified learning experience on the go and aimed at long term knowledge retention in developing minds!
